Machine learning models w/ scikit-learn


## models

- GPA and real_estate data are pre-cleaned, and test/train split is not applied.
- car_sales_lineer_regression covers all ML steps
- advertising_EDA uses precleaned **click dataset**.
- real_estate_of_nyc is **very massy**! dataset. 
   - real_estate_of_nyc_EDA, covers explatory data analysis
   - real_estate_of_nyc_lineer_regression, sale_price _prediction_
   - real_estate_of_nyc_knn, to _set empty_ neighborhoods
